"When love and skill come together, expect a masterpiece"â€”John Ruskin. 

My definition of success and happiness is not amassing wealth and material possessions; it is helping people chase down their dreams and achieve their goals. Watching them thrive and the happiness reflected in their smiles kickstarts an immeasurable joy and happiness within me. 

Driven by this vision, I embarked on a career as a virtual administrative assistant after earning my degree in Microbiology. I actively pursued every virtual assistant training and certification available, both paid and free, determined to master the skills needed to make a difference. With persistence, determination, and a desire for learning, I completed every course with undivided focus on the material.

While I already possessed skills such as touch typing at 120 words per minute and a strong command of graphic design software like CorelDraw Graphics Suite and Adobe Photoshop, I wanted to expand my impact beyond typing and designing flyers. I wanted to help people & organizations irrespective of their size or industry accomplish meaningful tasks toward the achievement of their goals. Becoming a virtual assistant allowed me to step into this world of purpose-driven work, contributing to the success of others.

Despite having few years of experience as a virtual assistant, some of my career highlights include:

* Calendar Management & synchronization for a Medical Doctor across multiple GoHighLevel accounts, resolving appointment conflicts and preventing double-booking.

* Design of custom project management sheet and dashboard in Google sheet using complex formulas and data validation, filter views, and charts to set automation and accurate data visualization 

* Internet research on fundraising and grants that could be applied for by an organization toward the achievement of its goals.

* Data entry and file management for departmental accreditation at Lagos State University of Education.

My key skills include: 
* Project management
* Calendar Management & Appointment scheduling
* Data Entry & Analysis
* Budget Management & Expense Tracking
* File management/Organization,
* Meeting Agenda & Meeting Notes
* Email Management,
* Travel Research & Creating Travel Itinerary
